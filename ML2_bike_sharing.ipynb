    "# Problem Description\n",
    "Bike sharing systems have become increasingly popular in many cities around the world as an eco-friendly mode of transportations. Accurate predictions of bike demands are needed to ensure availability and to optimize their distribution. Therefore, predicting future bike rental activity can help improving the overall efficiency of these systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we use the *Bike Sharing Dataset* from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alfiansyahputrans/bike-sharing-dataset) to develop a model that predicts the number of bike rentals based on several features such as weather conditions, time of day or day of the week, among others. The dataset consists of two CSV files: one containing daily observations and another providing hourly records. Whe chose to work with the hourly dataset, as it contains a significantly large number of records and offers finer temporal granularity, a helpful feature when predicting demand patterns in a stream learning setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a machine learning perspective, we are addressing a regression problem, where the target variable is a numerical value representing the number of bike rentals. The dataset provides real world data that varies over the course of two years (2011 and 2012) due to different temporal factors. This makes it well suited for a stream learning task, in which data arrives sequentially over time and the model must incrementally adapt to evolving patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of the target variable, it can be seen that the medium values are significantly more common than the extreme ones. That imbalance may difficult the learning process, as the model may be biased towards predicting the more common values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset may also be affected by concept drift, since bike rental demand can change over time due to factors such as changes in weather patterns, seasonal variations, or even changes in the popularity of the bike sharing system itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the model's performance, we use the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as the primary metric. MAE measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions. It is a common metric for regression problems and it provides robustness to outliers, which may be present in bike rental data due to unexpected events."
